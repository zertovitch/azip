gw - drag & drop a folder to Windows Explorer window or to the Desktop

gw - have a "truly portable" mode that doesn't use the registry. Either by:
      - command-line parameter: AZip.exe -portable
      - portable flag on program folder (?)
      - ask on first usage (detected by the absence of regisitry key
        and of a configuration file) which method is preferred.
     See https://sourceforge.net/p/azip/discussion/general/thread/3c5d77dc/ .
     The "truly portable" mode would work with a configuration file (azip.ini);
     if azip.ini is read-only (or the whole device containing the .exe and the .ini)
     persistence would just not be written.

Actions to be implemented:

  * Test recursive: test entries which are Zip files, and so on.
      See AZip_Common.Is_valid_Zip_archive for detecting Zip archives (could be .xlsx, .jar or other files...)
  * Touch (change time stamp to now or a certain date)
  * Encrypt entire archive

  * (2 or more archives) :
    * Compare
    * Merge

Bugs:
----

drag & drop to new archive: no password asked when encryption box is checked!
