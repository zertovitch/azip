AZip - A free, portable Zip Archive Manager
-------------------------------------------

  AZip is a Zip Archive Manager with a portable user interface
  and unique features such as: built-in content search, smart
  archive update, archive recompression.

  The goal is to keep the user interface as simple as possible and
  bother the user the least possible with options or useless gadgets.

Features
========

   * Aimed at simplicity, minimal option set
   * Usual archive management: Add / Remove / Extract files
   * Useful tools:
       * Content and/or entry name built-in search function through an archive - no need to extract contents!
       * Archive updater: changes only new, modified files
       * Archive recompression
   * Flat view / Tree view
   * Multi-document
   * Methods supported: Reduce, Shrink, Implode, Deflate, Deflate64, BZip2, LZMA
   * Encryption
   * Portable (no installation needed, no DLL, no configuration file (*))
   * Free, open-source
___
(*)  AZip can alternatively operate in a stealth "no trace in registry" mode.
        All you need is to put a dummy configuration file
        with the name "azip.cfg" in the same directory as the executable, azip.exe.
        If azip.cfg is read-only, user settings won't be remembered for next usage,
        otherwise settings will be recorded in azip.cfg instead of in the registry.


License / Warning / Legal stuff
===============================

There is NO WARRANTY in the AZip software.
AZip is licensed under the MIT License.
You find the full license and copyright notice in zip.ads.

Platforms supported
===================

  * Windows
  * Others: work in progess: there is a draft multiplatform GTK implementation
  * AZip's UI is mostly generic, so it can be implemented on various
      UI toolkits without redoing from scratch
  
How to build & modify AZip
==========================

  * You need the GNAT compiler: http://libre.adacore.com
      (Windows: the 2017 32 bit edition, not the later 64 bit ones)
  * For the GWindows toolkit: read the comments in the gwindows/azip_gwindows.gpr
       project file (just open as text file) for further instructions.
